A simple application to generate annotated plates_ used in biological experiments.

..  _plates: https://www.google.ca/search?safe=off&client=ms-android-bell-ca&biw=412&bih=354&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=UR_fWvKcN4e2zwL0pLzIAQ&q=multi+well+plates&oq=multi+well+plates&gs_l=mobile-gws-img.3..0i19.5038.11576..11722...1....152.2130.0j17..........1..mobile-gws-wiz-img.....3..0j35i39j0i13j0i13i30.kFVXWeyWf3w%3D

The main use cases of the library are:

* Working with a multi wells plate representation

* Set values or infos rapidly for each well on a plate

* Get a plate representation for other format such as markdow, html, rst ...

* Send data on a spreadsheet, iterate values by row or column, compilate multiple values from multiple plates in a unique table

* Use database to keep infos on a given plate type (volume and surface on each well, compagny url) and store plate in database
