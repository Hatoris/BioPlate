A simple application to generate annotated plates_ used in biological experiments.

..  _plates: https://www.google.ca/search?safe=off&client=ms-android-bell-ca&biw=412&bih=354&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=UR_fWvKcN4e2zwL0pLzIAQ&q=multi+well+plates&oq=multi+well+plates&gs_l=mobile-gws-img.3..0i19.5038.11576..11722...1....152.2130.0j17..........1..mobile-gws-wiz-img.....3..0j35i39j0i13j0i13i30.kFVXWeyWf3w%3D

The main use cases of the library are:

* call representation of a multi well plate

* set values or infos rapidly for each well 

* get a representation of a plate in multiple table format (markdow, html, rst ...)

* pass data to a spreadsheat, iterate value by row or column, iterate multiple value in same table

* use database to keep info on a given plate type, store plate in database
